1. which of the following HTTP request methods should not alter the state of the server?

  - answer -
  GET

2. What kind of SQL statement retrieves data from a table?

  - answer -
  SELECT

3. What is a common criticism of the singleton design pattern?

  - answer -
  It introduces unnecessary global state into an application

  - others -
  It does not allow lazy initialization
  It can not be thread-safe
  It is not object-oriented

4. What is a sticky session?

  - answer -
  A sticky session is a load balancing technique where each client is consistently mapped to a specific server. this allows the servers to store state locally

  - others -
  A sticky session is a particularly expensive HTTP request. Identifying sticky sessions is key to optimizing a web backend
  A sticky session is a user session where session data is stored directly in a cookie(rather than storing just an ID). This allows faster processing on the serer side
  A sticky session is a long running HTTP connection. the client can hold this connection open, and thus reduce the time it takes to make a request.

5. Which of the following is not a specification of semantic versioning?

  - answer -
  A minor version may be used to mark functionality as deprecated


  - others -
  Pre-release versions and build metadata are allowed
  A patch version may change the public API if it is backwards compatible
  Major version 1 is used to indicate a stable public API

6. Which of the following is a description of a write-through cache coherence strategy?

  - answer -
  Writing is done synchronously to the cache and its backing store.

  - others -
  Writing is done to the cache first, and later to the backing store when the entry is purged
  A time-to-live is written with the cache entry
  The least recently used entries are purged as needed for space

7. What is a risk of using a single sign-on scheme such as OpenID Connect?

  - answer - 
  It increases the impact from a breach of authentication credentials

  - others -
  It is a proprietary standard
  Third parties must store user passwords
  It prevents using multi-factor authentication

8. Which is not an advantage of vendoring third-party dependencies into a project's code base?

  - answer -
  Versions are pinned


  - others -
  Local patches can be maintained
  Builds and deployments are not dependent on network access
  Decreased repository size

9. Suppose an object-relational mapping (ORM) library syncs a database from source code models. what is an advantage of supporting migrations of existing tables?

  - answer - 
  To guarantee test database schemas match the production schema


  - others -
  To populate test fixtures
  To allow additional constraints of the tables
  Faster creation of test database
  
10. Which HTTP request header is used to identify the URL of the resource from which a request URL was obtained?

  - answer -
  Referer

11. Say you work for a startup that has hit hockey stick growth. you need to horizontally scale the database to support the increased usage. what are the trade offs between replicating vs sharding your database?

  - answer -
  Sharding is likely better to support higher write load. Replication is likely better for increased read load.

  - others -
  Peplication is easy, but does not bring all the benefits of complete sharding. if you can fully shard, you should
  Replication maintains better consistency gurantees at the cost of partition tolerance
  Sharding makes partition tolerance harder (because required data might be on a shard on the wrong side of a network partition), but supports better availability gurantees.

12. Say you are building a web forum application, where users can create accounts and post messages on forums about a variety of subjects. what might your relational DB schema look like?

  - answer -
  The schema will likely have a "users" table with info on each registered user(name, password hash, etc), and a "forums" table with info on each forum(like forum name).
    A "messages" table can then have the text of each message, a foreign key to the users table, and a foreign key to the forums table.
  
  - others -
  It's most flexible to use a stored procedure to pull together the data we need dynamically.
  The schema will probably feature a "posts" table with the text of every message posted, the name of the user who posted it, eg. "John Smith", and the name of the forum to which it was posted.
  A good schema is to have a "messages" table that contains the text of every message, and "forums" table for each forum. Because we need  a many-to-any relationship between message and forums, we'll allows
    need an association table between the two (message-postings) associating messages to forums.

13. Which HTTP method would efficiently check whether a resource URL exists?

  - answer - 
  HEAD

14. As part of a backend architecture, what is a potential disadvantage of using serverless computing?

  - answer -
  Higher latency of services that are used infrequently

  - others -
  Complexity from handling multithreaded synchronization
  Higher cost from unused resources
  Having to manually set up elasticity

15. Your web application, comprised of your custom application code and a relational database, was designed to run on a single server.
  To prepare it for production, you simply created three instances of this server behind a load balancer.
  Now, many of your users are complaining that some pages keep switching between old and new content when navigating between pages. what is the most likely cause of this behavior?

  - answer - 
  This is a browser caching issues due to a mismatch between caching headers sent by each server.

  - others -
  This caching of the DB tables is happening in memory without replication or invalidation against the other instances.
  The load balancer is using an IP hash policay to route requests from the same client to the same server instance.
  The load balanecr is sending traffic to only one instance.
