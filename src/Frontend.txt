1. Suppose you receive data from an API as a string containing a JSON Object. How should you convert this string into a Javascript object?

  - answer - 
  JSON.parse(str)

  - others -
  str.to_json()
  eval(str)
  JSON.stringify(str)

2. How do Webpack and Babel differ?

  - answer - 
  Webpack is a module bundler, whereas Babel is a Javascript compiler.

  - others -
  Webpack and Babel fill similar roles, but Webpack offers hot module replacement whereas Babel supports inlining CSS and images.
  Webpack and Babel are competing asset pipelines. Webpack is configuration-based and more opinionated, whereas Babel offers more flexibility by giving explicit control over the process.
  Webpack lets developers use new Javascript features, and Babel resolves module dependencies.

3. When testing your website against your API, you get the following error:
  Origin https://localhost:8080/ is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
  Why does this occur?

  - answer - 
  The same-origin policy restricts how scripts interact with resources on another origin. Make sure your API allows cross-origin requests.

  - others - 
  Modern browsers have sandboxed tabs, which cannot make cross-site AJAX requests. Proxy the request through your server instead.
  Browsers automatically include a convenient Origin header in cross-site requests, but it can be overridden to suppress this warning.
  Cross-site requests require a preflight CONNECT request to be sent ahead of time. Make sure you manually send this request before accessing the external domain.

4. What does it mean when a PATCH request has the following header?
  If-Match: W/"dl4c91f83b4554b6"

  - answer -
  The PATCH instructions in the Request should only be applied by the server if the resource is byte-for-byte identical to the version referenced by the "dl4c91f83b4554b6" ETag.

  - others -
  The server should NOT include PATCH instructions in the Response body if the resource is semantically equivalent to the version referenced by the "dl4c91f83b4554b6" ETag.
  The PATCH instructions in the Request should only be applied by the server if the resource is semantically equivalent to the version referenced by the "dl4c91f83b4554b6" ETag.
  The server should NOT include PATCH instructions in the Response body if the resource is byte-for-byte identical to the version referenced by the "dl4c91f83b4554b6" ETag.

5. For security, browsers enforce the "Same-origin policy". Suppose your script is served from:
  https://app.example.com/index.js in modern browsers, which of the following URLs are considered to have the same origin?

  - answer -
  https://app.example.com/static/imgs/icon.png

  - others -
  https://app.example.com:591/index.js
  https://app.example.com/users/sally
  https://example.com/index.html

6. For the following WebSocket, which of the following correctly registers messageHandler() to receive incoming messages?

  const socket = new WebSocket('wss://example.org')
  function messageHandler(event) {
    console.log(event.data)
  }

  - answer - 
  window.addEventListener('message', messageHandler)

  - others -
  window.onmessage = messageHandler
  socket.onmessage = messageHandler
  socket.onmessage(messageHandler)

7. Why are more developers using new style sheet languages like LESS and SASS instead of CSS?

  - answer - 
  They compile to CSS, but provide convenient syntax for nesting, variables, and other features.

  - others -
  They use an optimized subset of CSS which excutes more efficiently.
  They introduce new functionality not present in CSS, like styling parent nodes when their children match a selector.
  They enable more expressive templating by allowing Javascript to execute inside styles.

8. Why does the following tag appear in HTML pages?
  <meta content="4sWPhTlJAmt1IcyNq1FCyivsAVhHqjiDCKRXOgOQock=" name="csrf-token" />

  - answer - 
  It's used to prevent request forgery from external sites.

  - others -
  It's a user fingerprint used to track user sessions across requests.
  It's a cross-reference token used to correlate the response with server-side logs.
  It's a signed token used to verify the user id for AJAX requests on the page.

9. Which is an example of a "multipart" MIME type?

  - answer - 
  Form data in a POST request

  - others -
  The body of a GET request
  Multi-threaded Javascript
  Web fonts

10. You have a web app that allows users to chat with their friends. The app uses WebSockets to send text data.
  You would like to add a feature to allow users to send binary files as "blobs". 
  which of the following statements is true?

  - answer - 
  Your existing WebSocket can send and receive both text and binary formats, but you have to check the type with instanceof when receiving incoming messages.

  - others -
  In order to use the same WebSocket connection, you will need to implement a protocol to signal that the next message will be binary so that the settings of the WebSocket connection can be updated.
  WebSockets messages can only contain text data. So the binary files will need to be encoded in a text-compatible encoding, such as Base64.
  A single WebSocket connection cannot handle both text and binary data. You will need to open an additional WebSocket.

11. Complete the following sentence: When multiple, conflicting CSS rules match the same element, ________.

  - answer -
  the most specific rule is applied

  - others -
  the stylesheet is invalid
  the first rule to be defined is applied
  the element might "flicket" from the first and second rules being applied quickly in order.

12. To create web apps that can gracefully handle a lost network connection and sync data in a background thread after the device comes back online, you should use

  - answer -
  A Service Worker

  - others -
  The appCache API
  A worklet
  A Shared Worker

13. When browsers don't support a new feature, developers turn to polyfills. How do these work?

  - answer -
  A polyfill implements an API so that developers can build against a consistent interface, even on unsupported browsers.

  - others -
  A polyfill replaces the CSS engine on a page to support new CSS3 features like animations and flexbox.
  A polyfill is a wrapper around a lightweight version of the V8 runtime, which contains working implementations for HTML5 features.
  A polyfill sets flags on the browser's runtime that enable experimental featuers that aren't on the stable channel yet.

14. The following web application has an "index.html" that links to 3 additional resources.
  index.html
      script.js
      styles.css
      icon.png
  If this application is requested and served using HTTP/2, how many total network connections will be opened between the browser and the server?


  - answer -
  1

15. Suppose we have a page with the following 2 divs:
  what does the page look like after the following styles are applied?

  <style>
    div {
      width: 50px;
      height: 100px;
      padding: 25px;
    }
    #elem1 {
      box-sizing: border-box;
      background-color: blue;
    }
    #elem2 {
      background-color: red;
    }
  </style>
